## Prototype Overview
We have created the CGA (Computer Generated Animation) which uses pose detection and activity classfication technologies that enable animators to easily and effectively create animations from videos without the use of Mocap suits or other labour intensive processes. \

The Prototype consists of 3 main components: 
1. Pose detection \
   We make use of AI bricks and Mediapipe (with reference to tutorial by [nicknocnack](https://github.com/nicknochnack/Full-Body-Estimation-using-Media-Pipe-Holistic.git))
2. Activity classification\
   Using AI bricks
3. Animation creation\
   Using Blender
